 zmk config for the Tenax_Xiao split keyboard


 TENAX_XIAO is a 36 key column staggered split keyboard running ZMK, it is a fork of the original Tenax, which uses the blackpill controller, has no need for diodes and runs on QMK. The Tenax_xiao was made possible thanks to https://github.com/toniz4, who made the original Tenax and https://github.com/JonMuller, who changed the pcb to work wirelessly.
